The MiCS-VZ-89TE combines state-of-the-art MOS sensor technology with intelligent detection algorithms to monitor VOCs and CO2 equivalent variations in confined spaces, e.g. meeting rooms or vehicle cabins. The dual signal output can be used to control ventilation on-demand, saving energy and reducing cost-of-ownership.
